My name is Tim, I'm a 4A Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, with experience in software engineering, data science, and infrastructure development!

[Here's the link to my website](https://tim-chung.netlify.app/)

🧠 My fifth / sixth internships were at Cohere (foundations team) as a Software Engineer. I started by automating pretraining pipelines for encoding & packing, using Python, GCP APIs, Dataflow and Dataproc. I then joined the foundations team, where I helped process large and complex datasets that were used for base model experiments. I also spearheaded the experimentation for fill-in-middle and researched different pretraining methodologies to improve our base models' coding capabilities. 

♻️ My fourth internship was at Ecobee (data platform team) as a Software Engineer. My initial work was assisting in the creation of an ML inference pipeline, and an image annotation application for a smart home camera's CV model (backend work; requests in Python Flask, and database design / connection). I then transitioned into more infrastructure and technical debt work; upgrading GCP services like Composer Clusters, Dataflow Jobs, Airflow DAGS to production, all using Python and Terraform!

💼 My third internship was at BDO (Lixar Tech Division) as a Data Engineering Consultant. I worked alongside senior data engineers, software engineers, business & QA analysts, and insurance-expert clients to build ETL pipelines that automated the creation of IFRS17 compliant insurance files. Some technologies I used were Python, PySpark, SQL, and Azure Cloud tools (Databricks, Data Factory, Data Lake, etc...).

🔋 My second internship was in the nuclear consulting field (Nuclear Promise X), where I worked alongside senior ML engineers to predict project costs. I also contributed to an OCR project that involved training Computer Vision models, and helped ramp up the development of a nuclear-parts based e-commerce platform call Atomix.

🏛️ My first internship was in a government consulting sector (Transport Canada) as a SWE / Data Scientist. I was the lead developer for a time series and regression based software that predicted road collision behaviours. My other responsibilities included communicating with clients on weekly deliverables, and collaborating with senior economists / analysts to optimize our solution.

In my free time, I enjoy participating in basketball intramurals, competing in hackathons ([checkout my devpost!](https://devpost.com/timchung0319)), and [jaming out on my guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXwrIGC5QA)! c:

💬 Currently seeking Winter and Summer 2024 internships. Feel free to reach out to me about my experiences, and anything to do with tech!
