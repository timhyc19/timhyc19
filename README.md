My name's Tim, I'm a 3A Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, with experience in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering. 

My first internship was in a government consulting sector (Transport Canada) as a SWE / Data Scientist. I was the lead developer for a time series and regression based software to predict road collision behaviours. My other responsibilities included communicating with clients on weekly deliverables, and collaborating with senior economists / analysts to optimize our solution. 

My second internship was in the nuclear consulting field (Nuclear Promise X), where I worked alongside senior ML engineers to predict project costs. I also contributed to an OCR project that involved training Computer Vision models, and helped ramp up the development of a nuclear-parts based e-commerce platform call Atomix.

My latest internship was at BDO (Lixar Tech Division) as a Data Engineering Consultant. I worked alongside senior data engineers, software engineers, business & QA analysts, and insurance-expert clients to build ETL pipelines that would automate the creation of IFRS17 compliant insurance files. Some technologies I used were Python, PySpark, SQL, and Azure Cloud tools (Databricks, Data Factory, Data Lake, etc...).

I'll be starting my fourth internship at Ecobee as a Data Scientist, this upcoming summer (2023)!

In my free time, I enjoy participating in basketball intramurals, competing in hackathons ([checkout my devpost!](https://devpost.com/timchung0319)), and [jaming out on my guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXwrIGC5QA)! c:

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out to me about my experiences, and anything to do with tech!
